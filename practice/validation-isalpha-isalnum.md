## Validating Strings in Python / `isalpha( )` & `isalnum( )` String Methods

**`isalpha()`** and **`isalnum()`** are both methods used to check the character composition of a string, but they have different criteria:

**`isalpha()`**
* Returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic (letters).
* Returns `False` if the string contains digits, punctuation, or spaces.

**`isalnum()`**
* Returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (letters or digits).
* Returns `False` if the string contains punctuation, spaces, or other non-alphanumeric characters.

**In summary:**

* Use `isalpha()` to check if a string consists solely of letters.
* Use `isalnum()` to check if a string consists only of letters and digits.
