## Python: String Input Validation


### Instructions

- With your assigned partner, write a simple Python script that:

  1. prompts the user to enter a **string** and assigns the user's input to a variable
  2. uses the following string methods to check the string assigned to the variable:
     - `isalpha ( )` to see if all the characters in the string are letters
     - `isdigit ( )` to see if all the characters in the string are digits
     - `isalnum ( )` to see if all the characters in the string are letters and/or numbers (in other words, no spaces, no special characters, no punctuation)
  3. uses the `len ( )` function to check if the input string is at least five characters long
     - Display a message that says the input string is five (or more) characters long (if that is actually the case)
  4. Prints a message saying that the input string is all letters (`True` or `False`)
  5. Prints a message saying that the input string is all numeric characters (`True` or `False`)
  6. Prints a message saying that the input string is made up of letters and/or numbers (`True` or `False`)
