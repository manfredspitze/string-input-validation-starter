**`isnumeric()`** and **`isdigit()`** are both Python methods used to check if a string consists of numeric characters, but they have slightly different behaviors:

**`isnumeric()`**
* Checks for a wider range of numeric characters, including digits, fractions, and superscripts.
* Returns `True` for strings like "123", "1/2", "³"

**`isdigit()`**
* Checks for only digit characters (0-9).
* Returns `True` for strings like "123" but `False` for strings like "1/2" or "³"

**Summary:**

* Use `isdigit()` when you need to check for simple digit characters.
* Use `isnumeric()` when you need to check for a wider range of numeric characters, including characters that might represent fractions, exponents, or other numeric symbols.
